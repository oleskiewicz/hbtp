- offset in GR model
- f(R) model
- no redshift clusters
- why is GR & f(R) different in high redshifts?
- test different $f$ values (i.e. $50\%$)
- get hold of Aaron
- 1 sim with 1 tree finder (taking bugs away moves us further from Aaron's result)
- John & Jonathan has different trees & group finders
- Christian GR & f(R) box (with SUBFIND on it already)
- how c-m differs pre- and post- stacking 
- fit pre-stacking (Ludlow+2013)
