- plot c-m for different bins, use theoretical values of c to plot NFW profiles (compare to fits)
	- x-y: r-M, values from different mass bins, as well as analytical curve (steeper?)
	- compare concentrations of profiles of different mass bins on the same plot
- fit to individual profiles & average later
